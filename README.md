An Indoor Navigation System for the visually impaired.

INTRODUCTION

This is a project which aims to build an indoor navigation system for the visually impaired. Our aim is to make a computer vision model which detects lanes,objects and obstacles in a person's path and provides information for his or her navigation.


MOTIVATION

It is clear that even if a person is not completely devoid of sight, a trivial task like walking is a tough one in itself.Moreover, individuals with sight impairments feel helpless and dependent on other people to go around their surroundings. It may well be the case that overly helpful people make them feel inferior and this can easily take a toll on their mental health.

Another aspect of their lives is keeping or even finding a permanent job. Employers who are willing to take the risk feel they are a liability. Their assumption is based on the fact that a person who couldn’t even steer across his desk, how would he or she do the work assigned to them. This is not only a blow to their self esteem but also a major setback financially

One more aspect of a blind person’s life may be isolation. This isolation is actually caused by the fact that they can’t go to places or meet people. The confinement then becomes a bigger problem than the handicap itself.
We aspire to change this to some extent.


AIM

This project is an attempt to build an indoor navigation system for the visually impaired through software. 
It is not a general navigation system. We know the limitations of computer vision and our objective is confined to the indoors of an environment.
This is primarily because of the overload of information that a computer may experience while navigating a footpath or a busy street. But what it can handle and process efficiently is the navigation of indoors.


PREREQUISITES

 An intermediate knowledge of python, jupyter notebooks and their working is required to be a part of this project. The optional prerequisites are - 
 
LANE DETECTION :
A familiarity with the computer vision module of python.
Basic knowledge of edge detection, blurring, image segmentation.

OBSTACLE DETECTION - 
A basic understanding of deep learning concepts like CNN and YOLO models. 
Able to implement models given a basic task like digit or object recognition.
Implementation of Kalman Filter for object tracking.

Knowledge of basic git to understand the workflow is essential.

Anyone who has a good knowledge of python, but not computer vision, will also be suitable if gradual learning is done.





TECH STACK(To be used): 
  
Tensorflow and Keras framework for Deep learning.
Computer Vision for Image processing.
Pandas and numpy for data pre processing.
